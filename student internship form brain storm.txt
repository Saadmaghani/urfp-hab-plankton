1.	Research activities and research findings (about one page in length):
activities (its what i did):

(NEVERMIND)
- log
- database finding
- creation of a pipeline using pytorch
	- preprocessing
	- training
	- metrics
- made many models and compared them very meticuously 
- lots of changes to hyperparameters 
- trying to think of other ways to improve system
	- talking to Zhiming (phd scholar)
	- 

findings (conclusion of research paper):
- Transfer Learning best GoogleNet.
- definite class imbalance problem
- focal loss better when theres an imbalance, otherwise MSE is better
- using a TL model with 3 input channels (RGB, as its meant to be used) is better than 1 input channel (Greyscale)
- Adam better than SGD
- patience 20 is best, tried 40 and 10.
- tested different sampling techniques under different conditions


2.	Research knowledge and skills acquired (about one page in length):

- 

research skills (practical skills):
- logging (URFP Log)
- literature review
- methodologival approach in testing, evaluating and logging different ideas/variables against each other
	- spreadsheet
	- configurations.py
	- stats
	- URFP log
- learnt pytorch
	- transfer learning

	- model building
	- model testing and evaluation

4.	Benefits gained from the internship in preparing for future studies/career developments:
Benefits:
- in the process of learning how to write research papers
- know what to expect in the future of an academic career
- the skills learnt because of the topic will be used in my career as its a topic which interests me (computer vision)
- 


to test/make better:
