3/7 - wednesday
1.	the 103 categories of WHOI plankton dataset are not a super category of the 82 special planktons of the algae which cause red tides (taken from hk gov site). There are only 2 which match in exact name, 
	44 which match the first name (guessing thats a general name for type of plankton) and 36 of the remaining 82 which dont match at all.
	Idealy all 82 categories would match one category of the 103. ie. the 82 would be a subset of the 103.


4/7 - thursday
1.	regarding 1 of 3/7:
	a)	i started to find out what exactly the naming system is. i am using marinespecies.org to find out the meaning. 
		basically the 82 names are species names whereas the 103 are mostly genus names. therefore i have started to list which of the partial matches have how many species in each genus. maybe only one species for a particular genus will lead to good result
		results: only akashiwo genus had 1 child. the rest had more and thus completely useless. but we can change yes to 3 and partially to 43 yay lol
	b)	find another dataset of pics which give species
	c)	will find synonymous names to the species names. maybe of the 'no's there are matches when put to synonymous names. uhhh doubt it though.


5/7 - friday
1. 	regarding 2 of 4/7: 
	a) 	of downloaded multiple datasets. none seem to be promising however, online resources seem to be promising
			1- https://ecotaxa.obs-vlfr.fr/explore/
			2- https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/nauplius/media/copepedia/taxa/T2000000/html/photoframe.html
			3- http://www.ices.dk/marine-data/dataset-collections/Pages/Plankton.aspx
			4- https://planktonnet.awi.de/#search
	b) 	3 does not have images. 2 does not have enough images. 1 does not have images to the species degree which i am looking for. 
		4 i have emailed the PI and hopefully can download the entire dataset of images. however images are varied and will require a lot of preprocessing in order to be helpful for the ML task
2. 	regarding 3 of 4/7:
	a) I have not taken this approach yet because its unlikely that it will yield good results
3. 	another approach to solve 1 of 3/7 is to tune the problem to match the data. the WHOI dataset is VERY good but it does not solve the problem at hand and most of the datasets dont. 
	therefore maybe we change the problem? predict a few species which cause HAB? of the WHOI dataset only 3 species exactly match and 43 which partially cause. maybe change the problem
	to further classify the species given genus data. 
4. 	another approach - find a larger set of algal species which cause HAB rather than just the 82 mentioned... Will try this next!


6/7 - Saturday
1. 	regarding 4 of 5/7:
	a) 	looking at resources which gives more information about algae which cause HAB:
	 		1- https://www.whoi.edu/website/redtide/species/by-name/
	 		2- http://www.marinespecies.org/hab/aphia.php?p=taxlist
		certain genus are harmful, without exception, and therefore if we can detect the genus then we dont have to further specify the species. 
		will take note of which genus are harmful on spreadsheet.
	b)	1 is a subset of 2. therefore i took all accepted algae of 2 (311) and added it to the 82 species which cause HAB.
	c) 	now I have 11 algae which can be matched from the WHOI dataset from algae of 2 and 3 which can be matched from the 82. so total of 14
2. 	because I have 14 things which I can classify I will proceed to the next step but I have to talk with Zhiming (or Prof) about this dataset issue
	Next steps:
		a) 	data exploration with regards to the 14 things
		b)	pipeline. as of now this is what I have. Raw Data -> Data augmentation -> Auto-encoder -> CNN
		c) 	literature review
		d) 	hyper-parameters of CNN and Auto-encoder (get from literature review)
	Will start with data exploration today


8/7 - Monday
1.	Data exploration:
	a)	new document - data_exploration.txt
	b) 	make a python script (data_exploration.py) which gets all the #of pics per year per category (15)
	c) 	downloading all datasets on chiwah computer and then getting all the statistics (count). not a good way cuz chiwah net fast but computer slow.
		would rather have access to a better computer (maybe in a lab? lol). ASK ZHIMING ABOUT THIS
2. 	Literature review:
	a)	new google document - literature review
	b) 	references:

	c) 	Some questions to ask zhiming in literature review doc


9/7 - Tuesday
1. 	regarding to 1c of 8/7: 
		shifted work to GPU cluster. downloaded all datasets and started to unzip them. might need more space and time
